Check Reference
===============

This page describes each of the checks that ``pydistcheck`` performs.
The section headings correspond to the error codes printed in ``pydistcheck``'s output.

   :caption: Contents:

distro-too-large-compressed
***************************

The package distribution is larger (compressed) than the allowed size.

Change that limit using configuration option ``max-distro-size-compressed``.

distro-too-large-uncompressed
*****************************

The package distribution is larger (uncompressed) than the allowed size.

Change that limit using configuration option ``max-distro-size-uncompressed``.

files-only-differ-by-case
*************************

The package distribution contains filepaths which are identical after lowercasing.

Such paths are not portable, as some filesystems (notably macOS), are case-insensitive.

too-many-files
**************

The package distribution contains more than the allowed number of files.

This is a very very rough way to detect that unexpected files have been included in a new release of a project.

``pydistcheck`` defaults to raising this error when a distribution has more than 2000 files...a totally arbitrary number chosen by the author.

To change that limit, use configuration option ``max-allowed-files``.
